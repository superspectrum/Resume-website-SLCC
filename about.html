    <h2 class="headings">My Story</h2>
      <p id="bio">For fourteen years I worked and toured as a professional musician. Since leaving the
          music industry, I started working full time managing a local bar in downtown Salt Lake.
          When the pandemic hit the bar industry, I decided I wanted to make a change.
          Throughout my career in the music business, I have collaborated with other artists and
          have produced album artwork, tour posters, t-shirt designs, etc. In the summer of 2020, I immersed myself in obtaining the tools
          and knowledge necessary to become a web developer and designer. I have since received
          certifications in HTML/CSS & Github from Codecademy. I am proficient in Adobe
          Illustrator as well as Photoshop and continue to invest in my education. I have found an
          amazing mentor in a dear friend of mine who is a freelance full-stack developer, and
          have been working for him for the past six months. Along with his support and my
          commitment to learning, I am ready to take the next steps to further my career.<br><br><a href="SLCC-Resume-Bio.pdf" download class="download">Download My Resume</a></p>
